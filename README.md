# XV2 Save Checksum & Crypto Tool

A Python CLI tool for decrypting, editing, re-encrypting, and recalculating checksums for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 PS4 save files.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Always backup your save before using this tool. An incorrect encryption or checksum will cause the game to reject the save.

---

## üß† How It Works

The tool automatically detects whether the save file is encrypted or decrypted.  
It uses AES-CTR encryption with a static header key/IV for the save header and an internal key/IV stored inside the save for the main data.  
All internal checksums (1‚Äì8) are recalculated to ensure the save remains valid.

---

## üöÄ Usage

Run the tool from the command line with the path to your save file:

```bash
python xv2tool.py /path/to/savefile

    If the save is encrypted, the tool produces a decrypted file with .dec extension.

    If the save is decrypted, the tool recalculates checksums and outputs an encrypted file with .enc extension.

The script automatically detects the save format and handles decryption or encryption accordingly.
